## Dan Luu - hiring lemons

Dan Luu doesn't [shy away](http://danluu.com/wat/) from talking about [workplace problems](http://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/).  A recent post in that vein is called [Hiring Lemons](http://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/), where he discusses and debunks part of Joel Spolsky's "Finding Great Developers."  It doesn't so much discuss current hiring practices, but more so makes observations about the experiences of candidates.  My notes are mostly interesting quotations.

* In his experience, Luu has found that companies rarely understand the value of their great employees.  "When I worked at a small company, we regularly hired great engineers from big companies that were too clueless to know what kind of talent they had."
* Teams that have openings are more likely to have dysfunction.  Teams that are really good have low churn, and thus rarely have openings
* My wife chimed in to follow on to that; in those situations, people who could be good miss out on the chance to work with good people
  * She had left a job despite knowing there were some very smart people around her, but the work was not interesting, and there was so much churn that she knew the project would not attract other people that she could learn from.

## Matasano - hiring

In Dan Luu's article, he mentions "Matasano famously solved their hiring problem by using a different set of filters and getting a different set of people."  Googling "Matasano Hiring" takes us to [their blogpost](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/) about their hiring process.

## Moishe Lettvin - What I learned doing 250 interviews at Google

Moishe Lettvin used to interview for Google, and at the time of [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8RxkpUvxK0), interviewed for Etsy.
His perspective is mostly created from the Google way of doing interviews, but he does mention at the end that "Is this the best way?
Probably not."  One of his main points is that interviewing is about finding signal vs. noise; determining if a candidate will be productive
at your company, fun to work with, and able to both learn and teach others on the team.  He admits doing that is hard work, and likens interviewing
to literary criticism rather than statistics; lots of subjectivity.

So how can someone raise the level of the signal?
* Transparency - give candidates as much information about the interview process as possible
* Team effort - multiple people help round out the interview
* Be prepared - organizations should teach their interviewers how to perform the interviews

The other quote from this video that I love is that there is "no reason to have an air of mystery in the interview process."
He says that there is no advantage in keeping secrets about the interview process.  By being open, it allows you to let candidates know
that you're trying to allow them to show you their skills.

Raw notes

* Noisy, inaccurate, and arbitrary
  * you find people who know how to prep for Google's interview
  * lots of external things (bad day) that influence the interview
  * you can interview the same person with the same set of people twice and get different results
* "Everyone hired at google had a perfect set of interviewers, and a perfectly bad set of interviewers"
  * error bars for an interview are very large; not getting perfect data about candidate
  * Google sets the bar really high b/c hiring a bad person is much worse than missing someone good (introduces extra arbitrariness)
* Tells the story of when (not at Google) they were given a set of resumes, chose not to bring any of them in, then found out they were **their** resumes
* Data is a blessing and a curse
  * Pretty much no correlation between good candidates and their scores during interview
* You can't ask about what matters. What makes a great employee?
  * Relays a story where his mentor gave him the agency to solve a problem on his own
  * What question can you even ask to figure that out?
  * "Best thing you can do is give people questions that exercise their creative ability, their enthusiasm, sense of fun"
  * "Interviewing is more like literary criticism than it is about statistics"
* Interviewing is a team effort
* Be prepared
  * Teach people how to interview
  * practicing with a coworker is helpful, do a dry run
* Please make mistakes - iteration is key
* Every interview is a conversation (with goals) - not a test
  * Primary goal: happy candidate
  * Goal: Would I love to work with this person?
    * who you work with is the primary indicator of how much you like your job
    * can they contribute to the company?  Can they teach or be taught?  Inspire?
  * Goal: answer the candidate's question, would you love to work at this company?
  * Good interviewers are generous
    * honest, work for the candidate (be prepared, asking good questions)
    * he's had these interviews where he learns really interesting things from the interviewer
    * counterpoint to generous, time management; really comes with practice
* Good questions are like onions with lots of layers
  * better to iterate on a question and have it build up
  * with a set of different questions asked one after the other, it doesn't flow as well
* Strive for higher bandwidth
  * prefer in-person to video chat, prefer video to phone
* Artifice is inevitable; the interview is a different skill from being an engineer
  * Trying to look past that.  Can they learn, be enjoyable to be around?
* More signal, less noise
  * No reason to have an air of mystery in the interview process [35:25 - 36:13]
  * Give samples of what to do
  * Let them know you're trying to let them show their skills
