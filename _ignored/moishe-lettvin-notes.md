* Noisy, inaccurate, and arbitrary
  * you find people who know how to prep for Google's interview
  * lots of external things (bad day) that influence the interview
  * you can interview the same person with the same set of people twice and get different results
* "Everyone hired at google had a perfect set of interviewers, and a perfectly bad set of interviewers"
  * error bars for an interview are very large; not getting perfect data about candidate
  * Google sets the bar really high b/c hiring a bad person is much worse than missing someone good (introduces extra arbitrariness)
* Tells the story of when (not at Google) they were given a set of resumes, chose not to bring any of them in, then found out they were **their** resumes
* Data is a blessing and a curse
  * Pretty much no correlation between good candidates and their scores during interview
* You can't ask about what matters. What makes a great employee?
  * Relays a story where his mentor gave him the agency to solve a problem on his own
  * What question can you even ask to figure that out?
  * "Best thing you can do is give people questions that exercise their creative ability, their enthusiasm, sense of fun"
  * "Interviewing is more like literary criticism than it is about statistics"
* Interviewing is a team effort
* Be prepared
  * Teach people how to interview
  * practicing with a coworker is helpful, do a dry run
* Please make mistakes - iteration is key
* Every interview is a conversation (with goals) - not a test
  * Primary goal: happy candidate
  * Goal: Would I love to work with this person?
    * who you work with is the primary indicator of how much you like your job
    * can they contribute to the company?  Can they teach or be taught?  Inspire?
  * Goal: answer the candidate's question, would you love to work at this company?
  * Good interviewers are generous
    * honest, work for the candidate (be prepared, asking good questions)
    * he's had these interviews where he learns really interesting things from the interviewer
    * counterpoint to generous, time management; really comes with practice
* Good questions are like onions with lots of layers
  * better to iterate on a question and have it build up
  * with a set of different questions asked one after the other, it doesn't flow as well
* Strive for higher bandwidth
  * prefer in-person to video chat, prefer video to phone
* Artifice is inevitable; the interview is a different skill from being an engineer
  * Trying to look past that.  Can they learn, be enjoyable to be around?
* More signal, less noise
  * No reason to have an air of mystery in the interview process [35:25 - 36:13]
  * Give samples of what to do
  * Let them know you're trying to let them show their skills
