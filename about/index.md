I'm Matt Dailey. I've been a professional software engineer since 2010.

Currently, I work at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) working on the future of the data platform.

Formerly:
* Rocana - building a big data monitoring solution.

This blog is mostly anything longer than a tweet that I either worked with, toyed with, or probably just read about.

This blog created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the express purpose of putting it on GitHub pages, which is a pretty simple and fun to use service.  It also uses the [blueface](https://github.com/tnguyen/blueface) theme.
