I'm Matt Dailey. I've been a professional software engineer since 2010.

Currently, I work at [Rocana](https://www.rocana.com/) writing and testing an awesome big data solution,
while hoping our name doesn't sound like the [name of a Pokemon](https://pixelastic.github.io/pokemonorbigdata/).

This blog is mostly anything longer than a tweet that I either worked with, toyed with, or probably just read about.

This blog created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the express purpose of putting it on GitHub pages, which is a pretty simple and fun to use service.  It also uses the [blueface](https://github.com/tnguyen/blueface) theme.
